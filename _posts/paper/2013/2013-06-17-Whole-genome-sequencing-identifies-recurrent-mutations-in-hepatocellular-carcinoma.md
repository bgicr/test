Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly cancers worldwide and has no effective treatment, yet the molecular basis of hepatocarcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we report findings from a whole genome sequencing (WGS) study of 88 matched HCC tumor/normal pairs, 81 of which are HBV positive, seeking to identify genetically altered genes and pathways implicated in HBV-associated HCC. We find beta catenin to be the most frequently mutated oncogene (15.9%) and TP53 the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor (35.2%). The Wnt/beta catenin and JAK/STAT pathways, altered in 62.5% and 45.5% of cases respectively, are likely to act as two major oncogenic drivers in HCC. This study also identifies several prevalent and potentially actionable mutations including activating mutations of Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) in 9.1% of patients and provides a path towards therapeutic intervention of the disease.
