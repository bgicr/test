Lin Li as a senior project manager at medical research department of BGI Tech.
Lin’s current interest is to improve Cancer Sequencing Analysis Pipeline(CSAP) and develop Cancer Genome Interpretation Pipeline(CGIP). CSAP is a pipeline fully describing the genomic events in tumor and normal samples coming from a patient, including somatic variants detecting, purity estimating for NGS data. However, CGIP is a pipeline to analysis the characterization data based on cohort patients, including significant mutated genes(SMG), pathway enrichment, mutation spectrum analysis, mutation exclusive.

Lin Li received his bachelor’s degree of Computer Science and Technology from Ocean University of China. As a senior bioinformatician, he and his team are now working on cancer research. He is a member of the ICGC Data Coordination and Management Working Group, a key member of the China Cancer Genome Consortium (CCGC), and takes charge of ICGC-China data submission. Now, he is mainly responsible for the bioinformatics analysis of esophageal cancer project from China.

Lin has experience in detection methods of somatic SNVs, InDels, CNVs, SVs, Virus integration. These tools were important contents of CSAP.
